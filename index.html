    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the required growth rates to become a rich country before its demographic peak in 2035. The projected nominal GDP growth rate of 7.0% falls short of the required 18.0% annual growth needed to reach the rich country threshold of $13,000 nominal per capita by 2035. Additionally, structural constraints such as food inflation, stagnant job growth, and a rising trade gap hinder India's economic progress.</p>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>India's GDP growth rate is projected to be around 6.5% in the 2024/2025 fiscal year, which is below the ambitious targets needed to rapidly increase wealth, such as the 9.2% achieved in the previous year. A sustained growth rate closer to 10% is often considered necessary for rapid economic transformation.</li>
<li>Despite improvements, urban unemployment remains at 9% in FY24/25, with youth unemployment at 16.8%, indicating a need for more job creation to match the growing workforce. The World Bank suggests that growth-oriented reforms must be accompanied by an expansion in good jobs.</li>
<li>India's manufacturing sector grew by 9.9% in FY23/24, but productivity gains are needed to sustain high growth rates. The sector's contribution to GDP is around 16%, which is lower than many other emerging economies. Increasing productivity in manufacturing could help boost overall economic efficiency.</li>
<li>Public investment in infrastructure has been crucial for growth, but there remains a significant gap in meeting the required infrastructure needs. India aims to spend about 10% of its GDP on infrastructure annually, but actual spending often falls short. Achieving this target is essential for sustaining growth.</li>
<li>Child malnutrition affects 35.5% of children under five, and only about 25% of the workforce has received formal vocational training. Improving these human capital metrics is crucial for enhancing productivity and competitiveness in the global economy. The World Bank emphasizes the need for inclusive growth that benefits the bottom half of the population.</li>
