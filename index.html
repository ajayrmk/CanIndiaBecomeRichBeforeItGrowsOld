      <div class="subtitle">(as of April 03, 2025)</div>
    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the required growth rates to become rich before its demographic peak in 2035. The country needs an annual nominal growth rate of 18.0% and a PPP growth rate of 5.9% to reach the rich country threshold, but the projected actual growth rates are much lower, at 7.0% nominal and 5.0% PPP. Structural constraints include a sluggish manufacturing sector, persistent food inflation, and stagnant job growth, which hinder the implementation of comprehensive reforms necessary for sustained high growth. Additionally, India's current GNI per capita is $2,480.8, far below the rich country threshold of $13,000, requiring substantial and sustained economic acceleration.</p>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>India's GDP growth rate is projected at 6.5% for 2025, which is below the required 8% needed to achieve rapid economic development and compete with China's growth trajectory.</li>
<li>India faces a significant job crisis with an unemployment rate of 4.2% and youth unemployment at 15%, despite needing to create millions of jobs annually to absorb its large workforce.</li>
<li>India's workforce productivity is among the lowest globally, with the average size of land holdings being very small, contributing to low agricultural productivity.</li>
<li>Only 46% of India's cultivable land is irrigated, highlighting a significant gap in agricultural infrastructure development.</li>
<li>India's social welfare spending is relatively low at 8.6% of GDP, compared to OECD averages, which can impact human capital development.</li>
