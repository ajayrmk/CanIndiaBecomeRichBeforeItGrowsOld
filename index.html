    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the rich country threshold before its demographic peak in 2035. The required annual growth rates to reach the threshold are 17.7% in nominal terms and 2.6% in PPP terms, which are substantially higher than the projected actual growth rates of 7.0% and 5.0%, respectively. Additionally, India's current GNI per capita in nominal terms is $2,540, and in PPP terms is $10,020, both of which are below the rich country threshold of $13,000.</p>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>India's average growth rate is 7.2%, but it needs to accelerate to an average of 7.8% over the next two decades to achieve high-income status by 2047.</li>
<li>Only six million jobs are created annually with a 7.2% growth rate, while the working population grows by 10 million each year.</li>
<li>Labor productivity growth rate is 2.38%, which is relatively low compared to other rapidly developing economies.</li>
<li>India's infrastructure investment as a percentage of GDP is below the required threshold for sustained growth, though specific figures are not detailed in recent reports.</li>
<li>Female labor force participation is at 35.6%, which needs to increase to 50% by 2047 to fully leverage the demographic dividend.</li>

    <ol>
      <li><p><strong>Nirmala Sitharaman (Finance Minister of India)</strong>
   Nirmala Sitharaman plays a crucial role in shaping India's economic policies, including the recent budget that introduced tax cuts for the middle class, aiming to boost consumer spending and economic growth.
