    <div class="explanation"><p><strong>No.</strong> India faces a critical growth-rate shortfall against required thresholds, with nominal GNI per capita needing 18% annual growth to reach $13,000 by 2035 but achieving only 7% projected growth, compounded by structural constraints in job creation and productivity.  </p>

<h3><strong>Growth Rate Analysis</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nominal GNI per capita gap</strong>: Current $2,480.8 requires <strong>18% annual growth</strong> to reach $13,000 by 2035, but projections show <strong>7% nominal growth</strong> (implied from real GDP growth of 5.9–7.3% plus ~1–2% inflation).  </li>
<li><strong>PPP-adjusted gap</strong>: Requires <strong>5.9% annual growth</strong> but achieves <strong>5.0%</strong> (based on real GDP trends), extending the timeline beyond demographic peak.  </li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Structural Constraints</strong></h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Labor market</strong>: UBS notes insufficient "productive jobs for the rising working-age population," risking underutilization of demographic dividend.  </li>
<li><strong>Export competitiveness</strong>: Deloitte highlights "geopolitical uncertainties and delayed Western recovery" dampening export-led growth.  </li>
<li><strong>Productivity</strong>: Manufacturing and digitalization gains (projected 6.5% potential growth) remain below the <strong>8–9%</strong> required to offset demographic pressures.  </li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>Demographic Timeline</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Peak working-age population</strong>: 2035, leaving <strong>10 years</strong> to achieve high-income status.  </li>
<li><strong>Per-capita growth requirement</strong>: <strong>$1,052 annual nominal GNI increase</strong> (vs. <strong>$174</strong> at current 7% growth), necessitating unprecedented policy interventions.  </li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Policy Impacts</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal stimulus</strong>: Deloitte cites "significant uptick in government spending" driving 2025 growth to 6.5–6.8%, insufficient for GNI leap.  </li>
<li><strong>Inflation management</strong>: IMF projects 4.2% CPI in 2025, allowing moderate monetary easing but insufficient to bridge growth gap.  </li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>

<p>India’s <strong>5.9–7.3% real GDP growth</strong> translates to <strong>7–9% nominal GNI growth</strong>, falling short of the <strong>18% required</strong>. Without radical productivity acceleration or demographic rebalancing, India risks aging at middle-income status.  </p>

<hr />

<p>: The Conference Board projects 5.9% real GDP growth for 2025, while Deloitte forecasts 6.5–7.3% for FY2025–26.<br />
: UN Population Division projects India’s working-age population peak around 2035.</p>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Current FY2024–25 GDP growth projected at 6.4%, below the 8%+ required to achieve high-income status by 2047 (MoSPI/NITI Aayog targets).</li>
<li>Youth unemployment at 15%, with only 25% workforce in industry versus the 35–40% needed for manufacturing-led growth (World Bank structural benchmarks).</li>
<li>44% of workforce contributes 18–20% of GDP (MoSPI data), indicating labor productivity 3–4× lower than services/industry sectors.</li>
<li>Secondary sector growth below 6% (vs. 10–12% required for "Make in India" goals), contributing ~16% of GDP against 25% East Asian peer benchmarks (RBI reports).</li>
<li>Skilled labor participation below 5% of workforce (NITI Aayog 2023 data), with vocational training coverage at 2–4% versus China’s 15–20% (World Bank comparisons).</li>
