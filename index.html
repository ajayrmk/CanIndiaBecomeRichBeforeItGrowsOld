      <div class="subtitle">(as of April 10, 2025)</div>
    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the required growth rates to become a rich country before its demographic peak in 2035. The projected actual growth rates of 7.0% in nominal terms and 5.0% in PPP terms are below the required annual growth rates of 18.0% and 5.9%, respectively, needed to reach the rich country threshold of $13,000 per capita by 2035. Additionally, structural constraints such as persistent food inflation, stagnant job growth, and a rising trade deficit hinder India's economic progress. Despite being the fastest-growing major economy, India's current GNI per capita of $2,480.8 (nominal) and $7,340.0 (PPP) indicates a substantial gap to the rich country threshold.</p>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>India's GDP growth rate is projected at 6.5% for 2025, which is below the required 8% needed to achieve developed status by 2047.</li>
<li>Only about 20% of India's workforce is employed in the formal sector, with the majority in informal jobs lacking security and benefits. The unemployment rate is 4.2%, with youth unemployment at 15%.</li>
<li>Manufacturing contributes about 25% to India's GDP, which is lower than the 30-40% seen in many developed economies. The sector's growth is expected to slow significantly, from 9.9% to 5.3%.</li>
<li>Public capital expenditure has been subdued, with low utilization of capex budgets in key states, hindering infrastructure development.</li>
<li>Despite a large workforce, over 44% of workers are engaged in agriculture, indicating a structural imbalance in labor distribution. Additionally, food inflation remains high, affecting real wages and consumption.</li>
