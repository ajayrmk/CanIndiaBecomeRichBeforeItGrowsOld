      <h1 id="answer">No</h1>
      <div class="subtitle">(as of April 09, 2025)</div>
    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the required growth rates to become a rich country before its demographic peak in 2035. The country's current GNI per capita is $2,480.8, and it needs to reach $13,000 to be considered rich, requiring an annual nominal growth rate of 18.0%. However, the projected actual growth rate is only around 7.0%. Additionally, structural constraints such as food inflation, stagnant job growth, and a rising trade deficit hinder India's ability to achieve high growth rates. Demographically, India's aging population and the failure to fully capitalize on its youth bulge due to high youth unemployment further complicate its economic prospects.</p>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>India's GDP growth rate is projected to be around 6.5% for the fiscal year 2024-2025, which is below the ambitious targets needed to rapidly increase wealth. For instance, achieving high-income status by 2047 might require sustained growth rates closer to 8-10% annually, similar to what was seen in FY23/24 with an 8.2% growth rate.</li>
<li>Despite improvements, urban unemployment remains at 9% in FY24/25, with youth unemployment at 16.8%. This indicates a need for more job creation to match the growing workforce, especially in sectors that can absorb the large number of labor market entrants.</li>
<li>India's manufacturing sector, which grew by 9.9% in FY23/24, still faces challenges in productivity. For example, labor productivity in India is significantly lower than in countries like China or South Korea, indicating a need for technological upgrades and efficiency improvements.</li>
<li>Public investment in infrastructure has been crucial, but the pace of infrastructure development needs to accelerate. For instance, the government's capex utilization was only 37.3% in the first half of FY24/25, which is lower than the previous year's 49%, highlighting the need for more efficient project execution.</li>
<li>Despite progress, child malnutrition remains high, with 35.5% of children under five years old being stunted. This indicates a significant gap in human capital development, which is crucial for long-term economic growth and competitiveness.</li>
