      <div class="subtitle">(as of April 20, 2025)</div>
    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the required growth rates to become rich before its demographic peak. The projected nominal GDP growth rate of 7.0% is far below the required annual growth rate of 18.0% in nominal terms to reach the rich country threshold by 2035. Additionally, while India's real GDP growth is projected at 6.5% for FY 2024-25, this is still below the required real growth rate of 5.9% in PPP terms to meet the rich country threshold within the demographic timeline.</p>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><ol>
<li>GDP growth rate shortfall**<br />
Current FY2024–25 growth projected at <strong>6.4–6.5%</strong> (MoSPI), below the <strong>8%+</strong> required to achieve developed status by 2047 (NITI Aayog’s long-term targets).</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2">
<li>Manufacturing sector stagnation**<br />
Manufacturing contributes <strong>~16% of GDP</strong> (MoSPI), far below the <strong>25% target</strong> set under the Make in India initiative to absorb labor and boost exports.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="3">
<li>Employment elasticity decline**<br />
Job creation per 1% GDP growth has fallen to <strong>0.2–0.3</strong> (World Bank estimates), requiring <strong>0.5+</strong> to employ 12 million annual labor market entrants.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="4">
<li>Infrastructure investment gap**<br />
Current infrastructure spending at <strong>1.7% of GDP</strong> (MoSPI), versus the <strong>6%</strong> recommended by the IMF to support urbanization and industrialization.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="5">
<li>Human capital deficits**<br />
Only <strong>5.8% of GDP</strong> allocated to education and health (MoSPI), below the <strong>8–10%</strong> threshold needed to raise workforce productivity (World Bank benchmarks).</li>
</ol></li>

    <h2>Key Individuals Responsible</h2>
    <p class="methodology-link">Learn more about the <a href="impact-framework.html" target="_blank">methodology behind the ranking of key individuals.</a></p>
    <ol>
      <li><p><strong>Narendra Modi (Prime Minister of India)</strong><br />
As the head of government, Narendra Modi holds the highest scope of authority in shaping India’s economic trajectory, with direct control over policy direction and reform implementation. Under his leadership, India’s GDP doubled from USD 1 trillion in 2015 to USD 3 trillion in 2025, achieving a 105% growth rate unmatched by other major economies, driven by bold structural reforms, improved ease of doing business, and proactive economic policies. His decisions affect the entire population of 5 billion and multiple sectors, including manufacturing, services, and digital transformation, with demonstrated results in sustained 5-7%+ growth forecasts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nirmala Sitharaman (Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs)</strong><br />
As Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman controls India’s fiscal policy, budget allocations, taxation, and financial sector reforms, directly addressing key economic bottlenecks such as fiscal deficit management and capital market development. Her stewardship has supported India’s robust growth outlook of 5%-8% in FY 2024-25 and enabled critical investments in infrastructure and social sectors, impacting millions and catalyzing private sector confidence. Her recent track record includes managing pandemic recovery and advancing reforms in banking and taxation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sanjay Malhotra (Governor, Reserve Bank of India)</strong><br />
Appointed as RBI Governor in 2024, Sanjay Malhotra wields significant influence over monetary policy, inflation control, and financial stability, which are binding constraints for sustainable growth. His role affects credit availability across all sectors and millions of businesses and consumers. The RBI under his leadership continues to maintain inflation within target bands and supports growth-friendly liquidity conditions, crucial for India’s 5%+ GDP growth trajectory. His implementation power is high given RBI’s autonomy and operational capacity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ashwini Vaishnaw (Minister of Railways, Communications and Electronics &amp; IT)</strong><br />
Ashwini Vaishnaw oversees critical infrastructure sectors that underpin economic growth, including railways and digital communications, which are vital for trade, connectivity, and digital economy expansion.
