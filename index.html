      <h1 id="answer">No</h1>
      <div class="subtitle">(as of April 05, 2025)</div>
    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the required growth rates to become rich before its demographic peak. The projected nominal GDP growth rate of around 7.0% falls short of the needed 18.0% annual increase to reach the rich country threshold by 2035. Additionally, structural constraints such as stagnant job growth, persistent food inflation, and a rising trade gap hinder India's ability to accelerate its economic expansion.</p>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>India's GDP growth rate averages over 6.5% between 2016-17 and 2022-23, but to achieve rapid economic transformation, a sustained growth rate closer to 8-10% is often considered necessary for significant wealth creation.</li>
<li>Despite adding 170 million jobs between 2016-17 and 2022-23, India's unemployment rate remains around 8.2% as of January 2025, indicating a need for more robust job creation to match population growth.</li>
<li>The labour-capital ratio in India's services sector is 1.17, suggesting low labour intensity, which may hinder job creation in this sector. For comparison, more labour-intensive sectors are needed to absorb the workforce effectively.</li>
<li>India aims to increase its capital investment outlay to Rs 10 lakh crore in the 2023-24 budget, which is about 3.3% of GDP, but this is still below the levels seen in countries with rapid infrastructure development, such as China, which has historically invested over 8% of GDP in infrastructure.</li>
<li>India's female labor participation rate, while increasing, remains significantly lower than in many developed economies. For instance, the female labor force participation rate in India is around 25%, compared to over 50% in many OECD countries, indicating a substantial untapped workforce.</li>
