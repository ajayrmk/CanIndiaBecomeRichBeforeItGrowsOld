      <h1 id="answer">No</h1>
      <div class="subtitle">(as of April 16, 2025)</div>
    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the required growth rates to become rich before its demographic peak in 2035. The projected nominal GDP growth rate of 7.0% falls short of the needed 18.0% annual increase to reach the rich country threshold of $13,000 nominal per capita by 2035. Additionally, structural constraints such as stagnant job growth, persistent food inflation, and a rising trade deficit hinder India's economic progress.</p>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>India's GDP growth rate is projected to be around 7% in the medium term, which is below the 8-10% required for rapid economic transformation to achieve high-income status by 2047.</li>
<li>Despite a large workforce, India faces jobless economic growth, with workforce productivity being one of the lowest globally, and unemployment among urban youth remains elevated at 16.8%.</li>
<li>India's workforce productivity is significantly lower than global averages, contributing to inefficient economic output despite having the world's second-largest labor force.</li>
<li>India's infrastructure spending is crucial for growth, but it faces challenges in improving logistics and construction efficiency, ranking poorly in dealing with construction permits.</li>
<li>India's social welfare spending is only about 8.6% of GDP, much lower than the OECD average, and child malnutrition remains high, affecting human capital development.</li>
