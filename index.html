      <h1 id="answer">No</h1>
      <div class="subtitle">(as of April 04, 2025)</div>
    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the required growth rates to become a rich country before its demographic peak in 2035. The projected nominal GDP growth rate of 7.0% falls short of the needed 18.0% annual increase to reach the rich country threshold of $13,000 nominal per capita by 2035. Additionally, structural constraints such as persistent food inflation, stagnant job growth, and a rising trade deficit hinder India's ability to sustain high growth rates.</p>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>India's GDP growth rate is projected at 6.5% for 2025, which is below the required 8% needed to achieve developed status by 2047.</li>
<li>Only about 20% of India's workforce is employed in the formal sector, with the majority in informal jobs, indicating a significant gap in formal job creation.</li>
<li>Manufacturing contributes about 25% to India's GDP, which is lower than the 30-40% seen in many developed economies, indicating a need for increased productivity and sectoral contribution.</li>
<li>Public capital expenditure (capex) has been subdued, with utilization rates falling in key states, hindering infrastructure development necessary for sustained growth.</li>
<li>Despite a large workforce, over 44% of India's workforce is engaged in agriculture, while only 31% work in services and 25% in industry, highlighting a structural imbalance in human capital utilization.</li>
