      <div class="subtitle">(as of March 31, 2025)</div>
    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the required growth rates to become rich before it grows old. The country's current GNI per capita is $2,480.8 (nominal) and $7,340.0 (PPP), far below the rich country threshold of $13,000 per capita in both nominal and PPP terms. To reach this threshold, India would need an annual nominal growth rate of 18.0% and a PPP growth rate of 5.9%, which are substantially higher than the projected actual growth rates of 7.0% (nominal) and 5.0% (PPP). Additionally, structural constraints such as high youth unemployment, a rapidly aging population, and a lack of comprehensive economic reforms hinder India's ability to achieve such high growth rates.</p>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>India's GDP growth rate is projected at 6.5% for 2025, which is below the required 8% needed to become a developed nation by 2047.</li>
<li>The unemployment rate stands at 4.2%, with youth unemployment at 15%, indicating a significant gap in job creation for the 10 to 12 million young people entering the job market annually.</li>
<li>Manufacturing contributes only 25% to India's workforce, compared to a desired higher share to boost productivity and exports.</li>
<li>The government's capital expenditure is budgeted at 3.1% of GDP for FY 2025-26, which may not be sufficient to address the infrastructure gap needed for sustained growth.</li>
<li>Education spending is currently at 4.6% of GDP, which needs to increase to around 6.5% by FY2048 to support India's young population and workforce requirements.</li>
