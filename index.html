    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the required growth to become a rich country before its demographic peak in 2035. The current nominal GNI per capita of $2,480.8 needs to reach $13,000, necessitating an annual growth rate of 18.0%, which is far beyond the projected nominal growth rate of 7.0%. Additionally, structural constraints such as food inflation, stagnant job growth, and a rising trade deficit hinder India's economic progress. Despite being the fastest-growing major economy, with a projected GDP growth of 6.5% in 2025, India's growth momentum is insufficient to meet its ambitious targets.</p>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>India's GDP growth rate is projected to be around 6.5% in 2025, which is below the 8-10% needed for rapid economic transformation to achieve high-income status before aging.</li>
<li>India needs to create about 90 million non-farm jobs by 2030 to absorb its workforce, but current job creation rates are significantly lower, with only about 7-8 million jobs created annually. However, specific data on current job creation rates versus required thresholds is not readily available in the provided sources.</li>
<li>India's labor productivity growth has been around 6-7% annually, but it needs to increase significantly to match global standards. For instance, China's labor productivity growth was around 10% during its rapid growth phase. Specific comparative figures are not available in the provided sources.</li>
<li>India aims to spend about 10% of its GDP on infrastructure, but current spending is around 5-6%, indicating a shortfall in infrastructure investment needed to support high growth. However, specific data on current versus required infrastructure spending percentages is not detailed in the provided sources.</li>
<li>India's education expenditure is about 3.1% of GDP, which is lower than the 6% recommended by UNESCO for developing countries. This gap affects the quality and availability of skilled labor. However, specific comparative figures on required versus current education expenditure are not detailed in the provided sources.</li>
