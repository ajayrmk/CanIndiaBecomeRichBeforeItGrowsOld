    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the required growth rates to become a rich country before its demographic peak in 2035. The projected actual growth rates of 7.0% (nominal) and 5.0% (PPP) are below the required annual growth rates of 18.0% (nominal) and 5.9% (PPP) needed to reach the rich country threshold by 2035. Additionally, structural constraints such as stagnant job growth, persistent food inflation, and a rising trade gap hinder India's economic progress.</p>

      <li>Manufacturing contributes about 17% to India's GDP, which is significantly lower than the 25% target needed for sustained economic growth and job creation, as seen in countries like South Korea and Taiwan.</li>
<li>India needs to create approximately 90 million new jobs by 2030 to absorb its growing workforce, but current job creation rates are not meeting this demand, with an unemployment rate averaging around 8.18% from 2018 to 2025.</li>
<li>India's labor productivity growth rate is about 2.38%, which is lower than the 5% to 6% growth rate observed in more developed economies like South Korea during their rapid growth phases.</li>
<li>India aims to increase its infrastructure investment to about 3.3% of GDP, but it needs to reach around 5% to 6% of GDP to support rapid economic growth and urbanization, as recommended by the World Bank for developing countries.</li>
<li>Female labor force participation in India is around 32%, which is significantly lower than the male participation rate and the global average, indicating a substantial underutilization of human capital.</li>
