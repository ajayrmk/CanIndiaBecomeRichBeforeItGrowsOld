    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the required growth rates to become rich before its population ages. The country's projected GDP growth rates of around 6.5% to 7.3% are insufficient to meet the needed annual growth rates of 18.0% in nominal terms and 5.9% in PPP terms to reach the rich country threshold by 2035. Additionally, structural issues such as high youth unemployment, a brain drain, and a rapidly aging population in some regions further complicate India's path to achieving higher per capita incomes.</p>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Manufacturing contributes about 17% to India's GDP, which is significantly lower than the 25% to 30% seen in other rapidly industrializing economies like South Korea and China. This gap hinders India's ability to achieve rapid economic growth through industrialization.</li>
<li>The formal sector in India accounts for only about 10% of total employment, with the informal sector dominating the labor market. This limits access to better job security and social benefits, impacting overall economic productivity.</li>
<li>India's labor productivity growth rate is approximately 2.38% annually, which is lower than many other emerging economies. Higher productivity growth is crucial for sustained economic advancement.</li>
<li>India's infrastructure investment as a percentage of GDP is around 5%, which is below the 7% to 8% recommended for developing countries by the World Bank. This shortfall affects economic efficiency and growth potential.</li>
<li>Female labor force participation in India is about 32%, significantly lower than the male participation rate and below the global average. Increasing female participation could boost economic output by leveraging a larger share of the workforce.</li>
