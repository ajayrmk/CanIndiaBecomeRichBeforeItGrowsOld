    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India's current GNI per capita is $2,480.8 (nominal) and $7,340.0 (PPP), significantly below the rich country threshold of $13,000. To achieve this status before its demographic peak in 2035, India would need to sustain an annual growth rate of 18.0% nominally and 5.9% in PPP terms, while projected growth rates are only 7.0% and 5.0%, respectively, indicating a substantial shortfall in growth potential and structural reforms needed to drive such an acceleration.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>India's GDP growth rate is projected to be between 6.5% and 7.3% in the coming years, which is lower than the 8% to 10% required for rapid economic transformation to achieve high-income status by 2047.</li>
<li>Despite a large workforce, India faces jobless growth, with low workforce productivity levels and only 22% of the workforce engaged in the formal sector, compared to a need for higher formal sector participation to drive economic growth.</li>
<li>India's workforce productivity is among the lowest globally, with GDP per capita at approximately $2,134 in 2023, significantly below the $12,000 threshold for upper-middle-income countries.</li>
<li>India's infrastructure investment as a percentage of GDP is around 5%, which is lower than the 7% to 8% needed to support rapid economic growth and development.</li>
<li>India's human capital index is below the global average, with significant challenges in education and healthcare, such as 35.5% of children under five being stunted, indicating a need for substantial investment in human capital to support economic growth.</li>
