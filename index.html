    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the required growth rates to become rich before its demographic peak in 2035. The country needs an annual nominal growth rate of 18.0% and a PPP growth rate of 5.9% to reach the rich country threshold, but projected actual growth rates are lower, at around 7.0% nominal and 5.0% PPP. Additionally, India's current GNI per capita is $2,480.8 (nominal) and $7,340.0 (PPP), far below the rich country threshold of $13,000 per capita.</p>
