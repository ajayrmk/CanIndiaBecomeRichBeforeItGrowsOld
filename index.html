      <h1 id="answer">No</h1>
      <div class="subtitle">(as of April 06, 2025)</div>
    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the required growth rates to become rich before its demographic peak in 2035. The projected nominal GDP growth rate of 7.0% falls short of the needed 18.0% annual increase to reach the rich country threshold of $13,000 nominal per capita by 2035. Additionally, structural constraints such as a large informal economy and the need for substantial reforms to boost productivity and investment rates hinder rapid economic acceleration.</p>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>India's GDP growth rate is projected at 6.5% to 6.8% for FY24/25, which is below the required sustained high growth rates of 8% to 10% needed to rapidly increase per capita income and become a high-income economy before aging.</li>
<li>Despite a large workforce, India faces jobless growth, with low workforce productivity and a high unemployment rate among urban youth at 16.8% in FY24/25, indicating a need for more productive job creation.</li>
<li>India's workforce productivity is among the lowest globally, with a significant gap in productivity compared to other major economies, which hampers economic growth and competitiveness.</li>
<li>India's infrastructure spending is crucial for growth, but it faces challenges in execution and efficiency. For instance, government capex utilization was only 37.3% in the first half of FY24/25, lower than the previous year's 49%, indicating a need for better infrastructure development and utilization.</li>
<li>India has high child malnutrition rates, with 35.5% of children under five years old being stunted, and a low female labor force participation rate, which are critical human capital gaps that need addressing to support sustainable economic growth.</li>
