    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the required growth rates to become rich before its demographic peak. The country's projected GDP growth rates, ranging from 6.4% to 6.8% for the fiscal year 2024-2025, are below the ambitious targets needed to elevate GNI per capita to rich country thresholds. Furthermore, structural issues such as stagnant job growth, persistent inflation, and a rising trade deficit hinder India's ability to sustain high growth rates necessary for rapid wealth creation. Demographically, India has about 10 years before its population peaks, but achieving the required annual growth rates of 18% in nominal terms or 5.9% in PPP terms is unlikely with current economic policies and projections.</p>
