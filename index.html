      <h1 id="answer">No</h1>
      <div class="subtitle">(as of April 21, 2025)</div>
    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India is unlikely to become rich before it grows old because the required nominal annual growth rate of 18.0% to reach the rich country threshold of $13,000 nominal GNI per capita within the next 10 years far exceeds the projected nominal growth rate of about 7.0% per year. Similarly, the required PPP growth rate of 5.9% slightly surpasses the projected 5.0% growth rate, indicating a persistent shortfall in achieving the income thresholds before demographic peak in 2035.</p>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>India's GDP growth rate slowed to 6.5% in fiscal year 2024-25 from 9.2% in 2023-24, below the 8%+ sustained growth rate generally considered necessary to achieve rapid income convergence with advanced economies.</li>
<li>Manufacturing contributes about 16-17% to India's GDP, significantly below the 25-30% share typical of rapidly industrializing economies needed to generate sufficient quality jobs and productivity gains.</li>
<li>Formal sector job creation remains inadequate, with only about 10-12% of the workforce employed in formal jobs, while over 80% remain in informal employment lacking social security and productivity benefits; this is far below the 30-40% formalization needed for inclusive growth.</li>
<li>Labor productivity in India is approximately 28% of the US level and about 40-50% of China’s, indicating a large productivity gap that constrains income growth and competitiveness.</li>
<li>Infrastructure investment in India is around 7% of GDP, below the 10-12% threshold recommended by NITI Aayog and the World Bank to support sustained economic growth and urbanization.</li>
