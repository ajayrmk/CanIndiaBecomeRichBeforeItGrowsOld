      <div class="subtitle">(as of April 30, 2025)</div>
    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the required growth rates to become rich before its demographic peak. The projected nominal GDP growth rate of about 7.0% is far below the required annual growth rate of 17.7% to reach the rich country threshold of $13,000 nominal per capita by 2035. Additionally, structural constraints such as providing productive jobs for a rising working-age population and navigating geopolitical uncertainties will impact growth.</p>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>India's GDP growth rate is 8.2% in FY23/24, which is high but needs to be sustained at higher levels to achieve rapid economic transformation. For instance, maintaining a growth rate above 9% consistently could be crucial for catching up with developed economies.</li>
<li>Despite a strong growth rate, urban unemployment remains high, especially among youth, at 16.8% in FY24/25. This indicates a need for more effective job creation strategies to match the growing workforce.</li>
<li>The manufacturing sector grew by 9.9% in FY23/24, but its contribution to GDP is not as high as in other major economies. For example, manufacturing contributes about 16% to India's GDP, compared to over 30% in countries like China.</li>
<li>Public investment in infrastructure has been a growth driver, but there is still a significant gap in achieving the desired level of infrastructure development. For instance, India aims to spend about 10% of its GDP on infrastructure annually, but current spending is below this target.</li>
<li>The female labor force participation rate in India is around 20%, significantly lower than the global average. Increasing this rate to at least 40% could significantly boost economic growth by leveraging a larger workforce.</li>
