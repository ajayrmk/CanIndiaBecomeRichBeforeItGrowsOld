      <div class="subtitle">(as of April 13, 2025)</div>
    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the required growth rates to become a rich country before its demographic peak in 2035. The projected actual growth rates of 7.0% (nominal) and 5.0% (PPP) fall short of the needed annual growth rates of 18.0% (nominal) and 5.9% (PPP) to reach the rich country threshold by 2035. Additionally, structural constraints such as low labor force participation and the need for accelerated reforms to boost investment and productivity hinder India's ability to sustain high growth over the next decade.</p>
