      <div class="subtitle">(as of April 15, 2025)</div>
    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the required growth rates to become rich before its demographic peak in 2035. The country needs an annual nominal growth rate of 18.0% and a PPP growth rate of 5.9% to reach the rich country threshold, but current projections indicate a nominal growth rate of about 7.0% and a PPP growth rate of 5.0%. Additionally, structural constraints such as food inflation, stagnant job growth, and trade deficits hinder India's economic progress.</p>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>India's GDP growth rate is projected at around 6.5% to 7.02% in recent years, which is high but may not be sufficient to bridge the gap with developed economies quickly enough. For instance, to achieve rapid economic transformation, some emerging economies have targeted growth rates closer to 10% annually.</li>
<li>Despite a large workforce of 586 million, India faces jobless economic growth, with low workforce productivity levels. The unemployment rate remains relatively high, indicating a need for more effective job creation strategies.</li>
<li>India's workforce productivity is among the lowest globally, contributing to inefficient economic output. For example, improving productivity by even a few percentage points could significantly enhance GDP growth.</li>
<li>India's infrastructure spending is crucial for growth but often falls short. For instance, the government aims to increase infrastructure spending, but current allocations may not meet the required scale to support rapid economic expansion.</li>
<li>India's social welfare spending, including education and healthcare, stands at about 8.6% of GDP, which is lower than the OECD average. Increasing this investment could improve human capital and support long-term economic growth.</li>

    <h2>Key Individuals Responsible</h2>
    <p class="methodology-link">Learn more about the <a href="impact-framework.html" target="_blank">methodology behind the ranking of key individuals.</a></p>
    <ol>
      <li><p><strong>Nirmala Sitharaman (Minister of Finance, Government of India)</strong>
   Nirmala Sitharaman plays a crucial role in shaping India's economic policies, including budgetary allocations and fiscal reforms. Her decisions significantly influence the country's growth trajectory, with recent budgets focusing on infrastructure development and digital transformation. For instance, the government's emphasis on increasing public investment in infrastructure is expected to boost economic growth, as seen in the revised GDP growth projections between 5% and 8% for the fiscal year 2024-</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sanjay Malhotra (Governor, Reserve Bank of India)</strong>
   As the current RBI Governor, Sanjay Malhotra oversees monetary policy, which is vital for managing inflation and supporting economic growth. His decisions on interest rates and liquidity management directly impact India's financial stability and growth prospects. The RBI's recent adjustments in growth projections reflect the challenges of balancing inflation control with growth objectives, maintaining a growth forecast of around 6% for the fiscal year.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ashwini Vaishnaw (Minister of Railways, Communications, and Electronics &amp; Information Technology)</strong>
   Ashwini Vaishnaw's role encompasses critical sectors like IT and communications, which are key drivers of India's economic growth. His initiatives in digital infrastructure and technology innovation are crucial for enhancing India's competitiveness in global markets. The emphasis on combining manufacturing with high-value services aligns with India's strategy to move beyond low-skilled manufacturing, as discussed at Davos</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Parameswaran Iyer (CEO, NITI Aayog)</strong>
   As the CEO of NITI Aayog, Parameswaran Iyer is instrumental in implementing policy reforms and strategic initiatives aimed at sustainable development. His role involves coordinating with various ministries to ensure effective execution of policies that drive economic growth and social development. NITI Aayog's focus on inclusive growth and leveraging India's demographic dividend aligns with the country's long-term economic vision.</p></li>
<li>These individuals hold significant positions that influence India's economic trajectory through policy decisions, implementation, and international relations. However, for the most accurate and up-to-date information, verifying current roles through official government sources is essential.</li>
