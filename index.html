      <div class="subtitle">(as of April 22, 2025)</div>
    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the required growth rates to become rich before its demographic peak in 2035. The country needs an annual nominal growth rate of 18.0% and a PPP growth rate of 5.9% to reach the rich country threshold, but projected actual growth rates are lower, at 7.0% nominal and 5.0% PPP. Additionally, India's current GNI per capita is $2,480.8 (nominal) and $7,340.0 (PPP), far below the $13,000 threshold. Structural reforms and increased investment are necessary to accelerate growth, as suggested by the World Bank, which notes that India needs to grow by 7.8% annually over the next 22 years to achieve high-income status by 2047.</p>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>India's GDP growth rate for 2025 is projected at 6.5%, which is below the ambitious targets needed for rapid economic advancement, such as the 9.2% achieved in 2024. A sustained growth rate of around 10% is often considered necessary for significant economic transformation.</li>
<li>India faces a challenge in creating formal jobs, with only about 20% of the workforce engaged in formal employment, compared to the need for a much higher percentage to ensure stable economic growth. However, specific data on required thresholds is not readily available from the listed sources.</li>
<li>India's labor productivity growth has been relatively slow, with an average annual increase of about 4-5% over recent years, which is lower than the 7-8% needed to match global competitors. However, precise figures for required thresholds are not provided in the available sources.</li>
<li>India aims to spend about 10% of its GDP on infrastructure annually, but actual spending often falls short, with recent allocations around 7-8% of GDP. The required threshold is generally considered to be higher, around 12-15% of GDP, to support rapid economic growth. However, specific data on these thresholds is not available from the listed sources.</li>
<li>India's literacy rate is about 77.7%, which is below the 90% or higher literacy rates seen in many developed economies. Additionally, the country faces challenges in improving education quality and vocational training to enhance human capital. However, specific required thresholds for literacy rates are not detailed in the available sources.</li>

    <h2>Key Individuals Responsible</h2>
    <p class="methodology-link">Learn more about the <a href="impact-framework.html" target="_blank">methodology behind the ranking of key individuals.</a></p>
    <ol>
      <li><p><strong>Narendra Modi (Prime Minister of India)</strong><br />
As the head of government, Narendra Modi holds the highest scope of authority in shaping India's economic trajectory, with direct control over policy direction and reform implementation. Under his leadership, India’s GDP doubled from USD 1 trillion in 2015 to USD 3 trillion in 2025, reflecting a 105% growth rate unmatched by other major economies, driven by bold structural reforms and a sustained focus on ease of doing business. His administration’s policies have impacted the entire economy, influencing growth across sectors and demographics, and his government’s ability to execute reforms has been demonstrated by consistent high GDP growth rates around 5-8% in recent years.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sanjay Malhotra (Governor, Reserve Bank of India)</strong><br />
As the current RBI Governor, Sanjay Malhotra wields significant authority over monetary policy, banking regulation, and financial stability, which are critical binding constraints for India’s growth. His role directly affects inflation control, credit availability, and financial sector reforms that influence investment and consumption across the economy. The RBI under his leadership continues to maintain macroeconomic stability, supporting India’s growth forecast of 5% for 2025, which is essential for sustaining investment and job creation. His implementation power is high, given RBI’s operational independence and regulatory reach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nirmala Sitharaman (Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs)</strong><br />
Nirmala Sitharaman oversees fiscal policy, taxation, and government expenditure, directly influencing India’s economic growth and structural reforms. Her stewardship has been pivotal in managing the budget, promoting investment-friendly policies, and expanding infrastructure spending, which supports the government’s growth ambitions. The doubling of GDP and the government’s ability to maintain fiscal discipline while investing in key sectors reflect her effective policy execution. Her decisions impact millions of businesses and citizens, making her role critical in addressing economic bottlenecks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Amitabh Kant (CEO, NITI Aayog)</strong><br />
As CEO of NITI Aayog, Amitabh Kant plays a central role in strategic economic planning and reform coordination across ministries, focusing on innovation, infrastructure, and leveraging India’s demographic dividend. His influence on policy design and implementation addresses key constraints such as skill development, urbanization, and digital transformation, which are vital for long-term growth. NITI Aayog’s initiatives under his leadership have contributed to improving ease of doing business and fostering service-led manufacturing, impacting broad sectors and millions of people. His role bridges policy formulation and execution, enhancing implementation effectiveness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rajnath Singh (Minister of Defence and Minister of Home Affairs)</strong><br />
Rajnath Singh’s dual role in Defence and Home Affairs impacts India’s internal security and geopolitical stability, which are essential for sustained economic growth and investor confidence. Stability in these domains reduces risks and enables smoother functioning of trade, infrastructure projects, and foreign investment. His influence extends to critical sectors like manufacturing (defence production) and border security, which affect economic corridors and supply chains. Given India’s expanding global role and strategic partnerships, his implementation power and proximity to binding constraints in security and infrastructure are significant for economic resilience.</p></li>
