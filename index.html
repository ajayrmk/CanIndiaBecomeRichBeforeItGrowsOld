      <h1 id="answer">No</h1>
      <div class="subtitle">(as of April 24, 2025)</div>
    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India is unlikely to become rich before it grows old because the required nominal annual growth rate of 18.0% to reach the rich country threshold of $13,000 nominal GNI per capita within the next 10 years far exceeds the projected nominal growth rate of about 7.0% per year. Similarly, the required PPP growth rate of 5.9% is slightly above the projected 5.0% growth rate, indicating a persistent shortfall in income convergence speed.</p>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>India's 6.5% FY2025 GDP growth falls below the 8%+ annual growth needed to achieve high-income status before 2050, given its working-age population peaks around 2040 (UN projections).</li>
<li>Manufacturing contributes ~17% of GDP, far below the 25-30% required for middle-income trap escape, with formal sector job creation at &lt;5 million annually against 12 million needed (NITI Aayog estimates).</li>
<li>India's $7,400 output per worker (2023 IMF data) lags Vietnam's $11,400 and China's $21,300, requiring 6-7% annual productivity growth to compensate for demographic headwinds.</li>
<li>Current infrastructure spending at 4.5% of GDP (MoSPI) trails the 6-8% required for $5 trillion economy targets, with logistics costs at 14% of GDP vs. 8% in developed nations (RBI reports).</li>
<li>Only 5.8% of GDP allocated to education/health (2023-24 Union Budget) versus the 8-10% benchmark for rapid skill development, with 50% workforce lacking formal vocational training (World Bank 2023 surveys).</li>
