      <h1 id="answer">No</h1>
      <div class="subtitle">(as of April 01, 2025)</div>
    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the required growth rates to become rich before its demographic peak. The projected nominal growth rate of 7.0% falls short of the needed 18.0% annual increase to reach the rich country threshold by 2035. Additionally, structural constraints such as food inflation, stagnant job growth, and trade deficits hinder long-term economic ambitions. Demographically, India has only about 10 years before its population peaks, which adds pressure to achieve rapid economic transformation.</p>
</div>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>India's GDP growth rate is projected to be between 6.5% and 7.3% in the coming years, which is below the 8% to 10% required for rapid economic transformation to high-income status before demographic challenges intensify.</li>
<li>Despite a large workforce, India faces jobless growth, with low workforce productivity levels and a high unemployment rate among urban youth at 16.8% in FY24/25, indicating a need for more effective job creation strategies.</li>
<li>India's workforce productivity is among the lowest globally, with structural economic problems contributing to this issue. The country needs significant improvements in productivity to match global standards.</li>
<li>India's infrastructure spending is crucial for growth, but it faces challenges in efficiently utilizing government capital expenditures. For instance, government capex utilization was only 37.3% in the first half of FY24/25, indicating a need for better infrastructure development and management.</li>
<li>India's human capital challenges include high child malnutrition rates (35.5% of children under five are stunted) and low female labor force participation, which hampers economic growth and social development.</li>
