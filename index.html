    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the required growth rates to become a rich country before its demographic peak in 2035. The country needs an annual nominal growth rate of 18.0% and a PPP growth rate of 5.9% to reach the rich country threshold, but current projections suggest a nominal growth rate of around 7.0% and a PPP growth rate of 5.0%. Structural constraints include persistent food inflation, stagnant job growth, and a rising trade deficit, which hinder the implementation of comprehensive reforms necessary for accelerated growth. Additionally, India's GNI per capita must increase nearly eightfold to reach the high-income threshold by 2047, a feat that requires sustained high growth over two decades.</p>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Manufacturing contributes about 17% to India's GDP, which is significantly lower than the 25% target often cited for developed economies to ensure robust industrial growth and job creation. This gap hinders India's ability to achieve the desired economic diversification and industrialization.</li>
<li>Despite significant employment growth, India still faces a challenge in creating high-quality jobs. The unemployment rate remains around 8.2%, which is higher than the desired levels for a rapidly growing economy. Moreover, the formal sector, which offers better job security and benefits, accounts for only a small fraction of total employment.</li>
<li>India's labor productivity growth rate is approximately 2.38% year-on-year, which is lower than many peer economies. This slow productivity growth limits the potential for higher wages and economic competitiveness.</li>
<li>India aims to increase its capital investment outlay to enhance infrastructure development, but the current infrastructure gap remains significant. For instance, the government has proposed increasing capital investment to Rs 10 lakh crore, which is about 3.3% of GDP, but more is needed to meet the demands of a rapidly growing economy.</li>
<li>India's female labor force participation rate is around 32%, which is lower than the global average and significantly lower than male participation rates. This underutilization of human capital limits economic growth potential and hinders the ability to leverage the demographic dividend effectively.</li>
