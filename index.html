    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the required growth rates to become rich before its demographic peak. The projected actual growth rates of 7.0% in nominal terms and 5.0% in PPP terms are below the required annual growth rates of 18.0% and 5.9%, respectively, needed to reach the rich country threshold by 2035. Additionally, structural constraints such as depressed consumer demand and a less favorable external environment pose further obstacles.</p>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>India's GDP growth rate averaged around 7% from 2015 to 2020, which is below the 8-10% required for rapid economic transformation and to become rich before aging. The gap in growth rate is significant, as achieving higher growth rates is crucial for rapid economic development.</li>
<li>Despite significant employment growth, India's unemployment rate remains a challenge, with a rate of 4.17% in 2023, though it has declined from previous years. The youth unemployment rate, particularly, was 10% in 2022-23, indicating a need for more job creation to absorb the growing workforce.</li>
<li>Labor productivity growth in India was 2.38% year-on-year, which is lower than many other emerging economies aiming for higher productivity to drive economic growth. For instance, countries like South Korea have achieved much higher productivity growth rates in their development phases.</li>
<li>India aims to invest about 10% of its GDP in infrastructure annually, but actual spending often falls short, leading to a gap in infrastructure development necessary for supporting high economic growth. The target is to increase infrastructure spending to meet the growing demands of a rapidly developing economy.</li>
<li>The female labor participation rate in India is around 20%, significantly lower than the global average, indicating a substantial untapped potential in human capital. Increasing female participation could significantly boost economic output and help achieve higher growth rates.</li>
