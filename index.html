      <h1 id="answer">No</h1>
      <div class="subtitle">(as of March 30, 2025)</div>
    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the required growth rates to become rich before its demographic peak. The projected nominal growth rate of 7.0% falls short of the needed 18.0% annual increase to reach the rich country threshold by 2035. Additionally, structural constraints such as a large informal workforce, depressed consumer demand, and a widening trade deficit pose substantial barriers to rapid economic advancement.</p>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>India needs an annual GDP growth rate of at least 8% to become a developed nation by 2047, but it is projected to grow at 6.5% in FY26, falling short of the required threshold.</li>
<li>India faces a significant jobs crisis with an unemployment rate of 4.2% and youth unemployment at 15%, while needing to create millions of jobs annually to absorb its large workforce.</li>
<li>India's workforce productivity is among the lowest globally, with the labor force being the second-largest in the world but having low productivity levels.</li>
<li>Only 46% of India's cultivable land is irrigated, indicating a significant gap in agricultural infrastructure development.</li>
<li>India's education spending is currently at 4.6% of GDP, which needs to rise to 6.5% by FY2048 to support its young population and workforce requirements.</li>

    <ol>
      <li><p><strong>Nirmala Sitharaman (Finance Minister of India)</strong>
   Nirmala Sitharaman plays a crucial role in shaping India's economic policies, including taxation reforms and fiscal management. The Union Budget 2025-26, presented by her, aims to boost economic growth through measures like reducing income tax liability for individuals earning up to INR 2 million annually and supporting MSMEs. Her policies have a significant impact on India's fiscal deficit, projected at 4% of GDP for FY2025-</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Narendra Modi (Prime Minister of India)</strong>
   As Prime Minister, Narendra Modi influences key economic decisions, including infrastructure development and foreign policy. His government's focus on sectors like agriculture, MSMEs, and exports is expected to drive economic growth. India's GDP growth is projected to be around 8% in FY2024-25 and 9% in FY2025-26, reflecting the impact of his administration's policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>V. Anantha Nageswaran (Chief Economic Adviser)</strong>
   V. Anantha Nageswaran advises the government on economic policies, emphasizing the need for caution in interpreting GDP figures and highlighting the strong underlying growth story of India. His role is crucial in shaping economic strategies that address challenges like wage saturation and consumption patterns.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shaktikanta Das's successor, Michael Patra (Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India, acting as the current Governor in some capacities)</strong>
