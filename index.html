      <div class="subtitle">(as of April 19, 2025)</div>
    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India is unlikely to become rich before it grows old because the required nominal annual growth rate of 18.0% to reach the rich country threshold of $13,000 nominal GNI per capita within 10 years far exceeds the projected actual nominal growth rate of about 7.0% per year. Similarly, the required PPP growth rate of 5.9% slightly surpasses the projected 5.0% growth rate, indicating a persistent shortfall in growth momentum needed to achieve "rich" status before the demographic peak in 2035.</p>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>India's GDP growth slowed to an estimated 6.4% in fiscal year 2024–25, nearly 2 percentage points lower than the previous year’s 8.2%, falling short of the 8%+ growth rate generally considered necessary to achieve developed country status by 2047.</li>
<li>The unemployment rate stands at 4.2%, with youth unemployment at a high 15%, while 10 to 12 million young people enter the job market annually, indicating a significant shortfall in job creation relative to labor force growth.</li>
<li>Manufacturing employs only 25% of the workforce, whereas agriculture still employs over 44%, reflecting low industrialization and insufficient shift to higher productivity sectors; manufacturing’s contribution to GDP remains around 16-17%, below the 25-30% typical of rapidly industrializing economies.</li>
<li>Infrastructure investment and development remain inadequate, with persistent bottlenecks in land acquisition and labor market reforms that hinder large-scale manufacturing and export-oriented growth; specific infrastructure coverage metrics (e.g., road density, power availability) lag behind targets needed to support rapid industrial expansion.</li>
<li>India’s labor productivity remains low, with per worker GDP significantly below global middle-income country averages, and education and skill development systems have yet to close the gap needed to support a high-skill, high-productivity economy.</li>
