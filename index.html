      <div class="subtitle">(as of April 29, 2025)</div>
    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the required growth rates to become rich before its demographic peak in 2035. The projected nominal GDP growth rate of 7.0% falls short of the required 18.0% annual growth needed to reach the rich country threshold of $13,000 nominal per capita by 2035. Additionally, structural constraints such as providing productive jobs for a rising working-age population and navigating geopolitical uncertainties pose further challenges.</p>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>India's GDP growth rate for 2023 was 7.58%, which is below the required sustained high growth rates of around 10% needed to rapidly close the income gap with developed economies.</li>
<li>India needs to create about 90 million non-farm jobs by 2030 to absorb its growing workforce, but current job creation rates are significantly lower, with only about 3.5 million jobs created annually in recent years.</li>
<li>India's labor productivity growth has been around 6.5% annually, which is lower than the 8-10% growth needed to match global benchmarks and drive economic transformation.</li>
<li>India aims to invest about 10% of its GDP in infrastructure annually, but current investments are around 7-8%, leading to a shortfall in critical infrastructure development.</li>
<li>India's literacy rate is about 77.7%, which is below the 90% threshold seen in many developed economies, indicating a need for significant improvement in human capital development.</li>
