      <div class="subtitle">(as of April 17, 2025)</div>
    </header>
    <div class="explanation"><p>India faces significant challenges in achieving the required growth rates to become rich before its demographic peak. The projected actual growth rates of 7.0% in nominal terms and 5.0% in PPP terms fall short of the required annual growth rates of 18.0% and 5.9%, respectively, needed to reach the rich country threshold by 2035. Additionally, structural constraints such as low labor force participation (56.4%) and the need for substantial reforms to increase investment and productivity pose significant hurdles.</p>

    <h2>What Is Going Wrong</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>India's GDP growth rate is projected at 6.5% for the fiscal year ending March 2025, which is below the 8%+ growth rates often cited as necessary for rapid economic transformation. This gap highlights a shortfall in achieving high growth rates consistently.</li>
<li>India needs to create about 90 million non-farm jobs by 2030 to absorb its workforce, but current job creation rates are significantly lower, with only about 7 million jobs created annually in recent years. This indicates a substantial shortfall in employment generation.</li>
<li>India's labor productivity growth has been around 5% annually, which is lower than the 7-8% growth needed to match global benchmarks. This productivity gap hinders India's ability to compete effectively in the global market.</li>
<li>India aims to spend about 10% of its GDP on infrastructure annually, but actual spending has often been below this target, averaging around 5-6%. This shortfall in infrastructure investment limits economic growth potential.</li>
<li>India's education sector faces significant challenges, with only about 50% of the workforce having completed secondary education, compared to over 80% in many developed economies. This gap in human capital development hampers India's ability to transition to higher-value sectors.</li>
